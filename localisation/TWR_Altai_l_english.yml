An eager student and revolutionary from an early age, she became a member Tuvan People's Revolutionary Party and began teaching the new Tuvan alphabet in her efforts to eradicate illiteracy. One of the view Tuvans to have received a university degree, she rose along the ranks of the TNRP, taking positions such as Tuvan Zhenotdel, and Chair of the Women's Section of the Central Committee of the TNRP. In 1940, she became the Chair of the Presidium of Little Khural of Tannu Tuva, becoming the first female head of state in the modern era not inherit the title. As the leader of Tannu Tuva, her achievements were great but unnoticed by the unfolding war in Europe and after the shattering of Soviet Siberia, she remained as the head of state of Altai in a region aimed to get rid of her and her people by all means needed in the name of conquest. The strongest female revolutionary of Siberia stands against the world of warlords."
TWR_Toka:0 "Before the Soviet Collapse in Siberia, Toka was the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Tuvan People's Revolutionary Party and was the supreme ruler of the Tuvan People's Republic since 1932. When Siberia fell into chaos, Toka ordered his Tuvan troops to enter the nearby Soviet regions, merging Altai and Tannu Tuva into one political entity. To this day, the Altai Federation is the only Central Russian government that resembles a legitimate nation state, ruled by an iron fist."
