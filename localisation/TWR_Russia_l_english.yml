Two influential camps have emerged following his death, them being the populistic and reform-minded supporters of Pavel Zhigarev, and the more oligarchic, nationalistic supporters of Andrey Vlasov. The two have come to many blows with one each other, each having his own specific ideals of guiding our nation to the coming (and arduous) task of uniting these divided lands under a single banner. Both men have support from certain political groups within the nation, and either can court such peoples on the turn of a dime. But the true test of faith lies within the ballot boxes."

Running on a platform of empowering the upper classes of the Republic, as well as currying nationalist fervor in the common folk, it seemed an easy win by the end. Despite minor protestations from Zhigarev's reformists and other left-wing groups, Vlasov was able to peacefully assemble a new government and enter the Presidential office without trouble. Vowing to bring a new era of greatness and enlightenment to Russia, Vlasov briefly spoke outside the steps of the Presidential Palace - "The voices of Russia have spoken - And they desire a new era to spread upon these shattered lands," Vlasov stated. "Let me assure you, comrades: Under this new government, each one of you will once more be proud to call yourselves Russians.""

As the votes came before the electoral commission, the two men seemed neck and neck at many moments, but ultimately it was the populist and reform-driven Zhigarev that strode to the finish line. Championing a platform of reforms and policies tailored to the common man, as well as increasing democracy within the Republic, Zhigarev's victory was hard fought - even met with reactions of disbelief from the man himself. With the new government being sworn in shortly, President Zhigarev addressed his supporters, thanking them for their strong support and commitment to populist ideals. Also seen in the crowd was Vlasov himself, flanked by his cohorts. \n\nAs Zhigarev read from his closing arguments, those in the crowd reported seeing Vlasov walking away from the throng, evidently flustered, and muttering under his breath."

President Vlasov has proposed the notion of a Republican Front - A unitary coalition between the various parties whose shared goals are the gradual unification of the shattered lands to the west. Building off of this desire would easily win over deputies within the Duma who see our government with feelings of animosity. Akin to a National Front of sorts, this Republican Front would be less likely to bicker and quabble over various key reforms if the ultimate end goal is the complete uniting of our peoples across Russia. With no time to lose, let us make the arrangements as soon as possible."

Our current structure is much too decentralized for President Vlasov's liking, and has entrusted upon us the formation of such an aforementioned office. When it's creation is finalized, the State Security Bureau shall be tasked with all duties relating to internal affairs, national security, and limited foreign intelligence gathering. Stability comes from many notions - But the most powerful of all is through the careful waters of internal affairs.

By all means, it seems only natural for our government to reward such members of society with roles in our administration, as well as shaping them into a more cohesive whole. Oligarchs, as they are called, will certainly be looked down by the more intellectual common folks in the nation, but their voices are far off in the distance.

Many times, nations have swallowed parts of their own sovereignty to further progress - It is no different with our own situation. Meetings shall be arranged within the coming days.

But there is still work to be done. The stabilization of the Republic is still much needed - Our government enjoys comfortable support from the upper classes of the nation as well as patriotic commoners, but there are still those who disagree with our great progress. Naturally, these rogue groups who seek only to cause trouble will be dealt with accordingly. We shall enlist the State Security Bureau to arrange some convenient disappearances of their alleged ringleaders, as well as rounding up their underlings by tried and true police work. \n\nStability and safety will come to our nation - by any means necessary if it comes to it."

These ideas only serve to remind us of the past - Of a nation that decided to accept a cautious standstill with the German beast, rather than banishing them from whence they came. It's very clear to our government what must be done: The arrangement of an anti-Communist front within the national legislature. By uniting all parties together against these senseless reds, we can continue to ensure the safety of our institutions and peoples. \n\nThe future of Russia is within our Republic - Not some silly union of limp-wristed workers' councils."

Certain aspects of our economy lag behind while others advance at a steady pace. Something must be done to increase the flow of skilled laborers into the workforce to reinforce and strengthen the economy at a breakneck speed. Our government has come up with an obvious solution - The institution of an immigration programme, allowing both skilled and unskilled laborers from the various states to the west to be processed more easily, as well as possibly looking towards America for highly skilled workers. Despite the apprehension by some members of government, such policies are a necessity if our national economy is to continue to survive and prosper."

With that in mind, our continued loyalty to Washington is of the utmost importance. Should our allegiance loosen even in the slightest, it will surely spell problems for our country.

Shoring up their support would likely boost our standing within the legislature considerably, allowing us to more easily navigate the passage of key legislation President Zhigarev's government wishes to introduce.

 RUS_The_Zhigarev_Revolution_desc:0 "With political stability secured and our government adequately strengthened, it now time for the nitty gritty of President Zhigarev's plans. Referred to as the Zhigarev Revolution by the President's allies, the move calls for a three-pronged approach: The passage of key land reform, a proposal that is sure to be an uphill battle within the legislature, the drafting and raising of republican militias to form the backbone of a true standing army, and the establishment of Jewish communities in our city centers. The latter is surely to be contested by more right-wing groups within our Republic - Specifically Vlasov and his cohorts. Obstacles all the same, each is able to be overcome with just the right amount of effort and intuition. \n\nLet us embark upon the path of true betterment for our young nation!"

Landed elites who hardly trek across the vast tracts of land they hold title to hardly even visit such properties, leading to massive disgruntlement among laborers and farmers who could use such plots to boost agricultural diversity and output. The obvious solution is to draft immediate land reform, buying out these plots which lay constricted in the hands of these men and redistributing them among the commoners. Naturally protests by these elites will be by the dozen - But if they don't like it, then they can take their fortunes and settle in America somewhere. Surely if they're willing to choke out vast areas of the virgin lands of Siberia, then they won't mind moving elsewhere!"

Some analysts, as well as generals within the Defense Ministry state that our Republic technically doesn't have a proper army at all. The natural solution to this without going too overboard and causing undue strain to our budget would be the raising of sizable, yet local militias dedicated to the defense of individual towns and cities of our Republic. With such ideals, the common man will have a feeling of patriotism and commitment to protecting his nation instilled within him, alongside granting the added benefit of safeguarding his local citizens. Such a plan can serve as an adequate solution for the time being as more cohesive strategies and systems for national defense are developed in the future."

Many have been welcomed with hospitality and care, whilst some still face harassment and ridicule. Conditions such as the latter are unacceptable within our nation and must be removed from our society. President Zhigarev has drafted plans to foster dedicated Jewish communities within the nation, where their members can be free of scorn or open disdain and be able to live freely."

We must resolve these lingering problems by any means necessary - Funding more to our internal affairs agencies, consulting with Washington on learning to better deal with such issues, as well as various other measures. By concentrating our efforts on resolving instability, we can allow a much greater focus on completing the policies of President Zhigarev's revolution - Bringing our nation into a true age of prosperity and modernity."

 RUS_Plan_Rigged_Elections_desc:0 "The election for the Presidency wasn't really an election, per se. As citizens are more concerned with ensuring their own survival and gaining of basic amenities, engaging in voting is far down their list of desires. As such, the race was voted upon by deputies of the legislature. Now that some time has passed, and our nation stands in a much different place than it was before, there has been considerable talk by both camps within the Duma to begin the slow process of democratization - Namely the arrangement of rigged elections. Providing a façade of democracy may be just enough to put most citizens at ease and continue their faith and trust in our administration, allowing us to worry less about such concerns. As such, it is pertinent that we draft concrete election cycles for the foreseeable future."

By adopting their strategies and systems our nation will be more able to adequately modernize and adapt to certain situations. Such cooperation would also lay the groundwork for a healthy diplomatic relationship between our two governments.

The banner armies of the east were left as garrisons in the cities they were stationed in, and the last pieces of soviet 'organization' fell away. \n\nJapan fell to allied assault in 1945, soon after the Chinese Civil War was restarted, and the Americans realized the situation which the Russian Far East was left in. On march 1946, the US Marine Corps in Asia launch a naval and land offensive into soviet territory in Asia, and with little resistance manage to capture the far east. Sergei Wojciechowski, a former white army general residing in the US was installed as the president of the new 'Russian Republic', based in Vladivostok. \n\nFormer white emigres along with their children, living in America, moved into the nominally independent country. Contact was made with cities deeper inland, and they were formally annexed into Russia. The military was set up divisionally from the remaints of soviet forces.
