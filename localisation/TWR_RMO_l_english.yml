 ##Focus
 RMO_Moskowien_in_Chaos:0 "Moskowien in Chaos"
 RMO_Moskowien_in_Chaos_desc:0 "It was only a matter of time. We should have been more prepared. The flames of revolution are burning brightly. The chaos sweeping the Reich has reached us here on the frontier. We're a long way away from Germany and we're on our own."
 RMO_Relocate_the_Work_Camps:0 "Relocate the Work Camps"
 RMO_Relocate_the_Work_Camps_desc:0 "We need to relocate our work camps to settler-controlled territory as soon as possible. With the rapid advance of the enemy lines, there's a non-negligible possibility that any prisoners they free will join their ranks. We cannot afford to lose the labor our vast prison population provides."
 RMO_The_Last_Fight:0 "The Last Fight"
 RMO_The_Last_Fight_desc:0 "The uphill battle we've been fighting has quickly become hopeless. Our lines are crumbling and the natives are flocking to the rebels in droves. We can't continue on like this. The time has come to make our stand. We will live or die as free men."
 RMO_Terror_Tactics:0 "Terror Tactics"
 RMO_Terror_Tactics_desc:0 "The rebels are ruthless. We will have to be worse. Our SA security forces can't be beholden to restraint in times such as these. We must harden our hearts and dig in our heels. If the Slavs want their freedom so bad we'll make them earn it."
 RMO_Establish_the_Reichsautonomie:0 "Establish the Reichsautonomie"
 RMO_Establish_the_Reichsautonomie_desc:0 "A radical reform has been proposed: delegate more power to local governments and autonomous settler communities. Unfortunately, this will give the natives more representation and agency to manage their affairs, but we have to bring them to the negotiating table somehow."
 RMO_The_Slavic_Solution:0 "The Slavic Solution"
 RMO_The_Slavic_Solution_desc:0 "We need to recruit natives into the ranks of the SA. They'll earn a soldier's wages and certain political benefits should our government weather this storm. This isn't a popular proposal but we need the manpower. If it helps us pull through then it's worth a shot."
 RMO_Abandon_the_Kommissariat:0 "Abandon the Kommissariat"
 RMO_Abandon_the_Kommissariat_desc:0 "We need to get out of this God-forsaken colony and never look back. We have the planes fueled and ready to go. Kasche and his top personnel are ready to fly back to Metropolitan Germany with heir suitcases full of money and important documents. Let's cut our losses."
 RMO_Evacuate_the_Germans:0 "Evacuate the Germans"
 RMO_Evacuate_the_Germans_desc:0 "The rebels will slay us to a man. A worryingly large percentage of the settler population is still in the RK. We can't save them all but we can try to evacuate the richer and more affluent among them. Our Luftwaffe will evacuate them back to Metropolitan Germany."
 RMO_Our_Final_Hours:0 "Our Final Hours"
 RMO_Our_Final_Hours_desc:0 "The clock has struck twelve. There will be no retreat and no surrender. What's left of the armed forces have fortified themselves in the territory we still control. All we can do now is hold out while taking down as many of them with us as possible."
 
 RMO_Return_of_Stability:0 "Return of Stability"
 RMO_Return_of_Stability_desc:0 "Against all odds, our administration has survived the native uprisings. Now that storm has passed, it's time to rebuild our proud colony. We were too lenient with the natives and now a firmer hand is required."
 RMO_Oust_the_Former_Government:0 "Oust the Former Government"
 RMO_Oust_the_Former_Government_desc:0 "Sigfried Kasche has failed in his duties. From the beginning his reliability was called into question due to his SA background. He should not have been allowed to survive Operation Hummingbird. His mismanagement will cause more problems if preventive measures aren't taken."
 RMO_Relocate_the_Capital:0 "Relocate the Capital"
 RMO_Relocate_the_Capital_desc:0 "Moskow is too politically insecure to be the seat of our government. We shall therefore operate from Arkhangelsk instead, as its proximity to Metropolitan Germany via the Baltic sea and higher German population will better suit our needs. The nearby Kriegsmarine fleets will provide some security."
 RMO_Restore_the_Kommissariat:0 "Restore the Kommissariat"
 RMO_Restore_the_Kommissariat_desc:0 "Sigfried Kasche performed admirably during the civil war. For his diligence and steadfast devotion to the Aryan volk, his administration will be reinstated at once. Mistakes were made but his experience will prove invaluable to our colonization efforts."
 RMO_Sturmabteilung_Policing:0 "Sturmabteilung Policing"
 RMO_Sturmabteilung_Policing_desc:0 "The SA has served the colony well ever since Kasche revived the organization to act as his security wing. Despite the SS's treachery during the civil war, the SA remained loyal and reliable. For that they should be rewarded. Their policing and anti-partisan services are in high demand."
 RMO_Decentralize_the_Government:0 "Decentralize the Government"
 RMO_Decentralize_the_Government_desc:0 "Further decentralization will be required to restore Moskowien's functionality. Greater authority will be vested in local and regional officials to manage their own affairs. This will hopefully ease tensions with settler leaders. It will also give native collaborator officials more of a say in the RK's governance."
 RMO_The_Autonomous_German_Communities:0 "The Autonomous German Communities"
 RMO_The_Autonomous_German_Communities_desc:0 "From now on, the RK's settler communities will operate with greater autonomy than they have previously. They'll still answer to us but they'll be permitted to pass their own legislation and handle local affairs at their own discretion."
 RMO_Arisches_Schicksai:0 "Arisches Schicksai"
 RMO_Arisches_Schicksai_desc:0 "We Aryan men are destined to tame this land for our families, our volk, and our nation. We won't live in peace until the Slavs are vanquished. We need to expand the settlements and bring in more good German families from back home. The population shall increase tenfold!"
 RMO_Minimalistic_Administration:0 "Minimalistic Administration"
 RMO_Minimalistic_Administration_desc:0 "Less government is the best government. We'll allow local administrators to do as they please without interfering in their collections. Moskowien will be all the better for it. The Slavic collaborators will have the petty power they so desire. Hopefully they'll keep the rest of their kind in line."
 RMO_Resume_Basic_Operations:0 "Resume Basic Operations"
 RMO_Resume_Basic_Operations_desc:0 "Now that some measure of stability has returned, agricultural and industrial productions are to resume immediately. The natives will have to get back to work if they want to hold on to what few privileges they have left. Things should be smoother from here on out."

 RSB_Tachanka:0 "Modern Tachankas"
 RSB_Tachanka_desc:0 "Inspired by Nestor Makhno and limited by local resources, the anarchists have managed to scramble a dozen of Tachanka Brigades with stolen equipment. These open wagons are equipped with Soviet and German machine guns, designed to be the best alternative to conventional motorize equipment, creating the strange phenomenon which modern equipment such as MG-42 strapped onto a wagon pulled by horses."
 WRM_White_Army:0 "New White Army"
 WRM_White_Army_desc:0 "Due to the amount of ex-White military staff working for the army, this created the appearance of a new White Army within Moskowien. With similar tactics, and a number of former White Army officers being part of the force."
 RMO_unloyal_servants:0 "Unloyal Collaborators"
 RMO_unloyal_servants_desc:0 "While the Moskowien's stance on native slavs have been a harsh one, the Reichskommissariat had no choice but to collaborate with certain groups of natives. These Slavic collaborators are used as factory inspectors, auxiliary law enforcers, and even a form of political entity. However, these groups' loyalty are questionable, and it's possible that most of them are plotting Moskowien's demise."
 RMO_uncontrolled_corruption:0 "Uncontrolled Corruption"
 RMO_uncontrolled_corruption_desc:0 "While corruption is a problem for all of the Reichskommissariats, it is especially worse within Moskowien. The government is virtually non-functional with the insane amount of delays and corruption involved."
 RMO_slave_factories:0 "The Slave State"
 RMO_slave_factories_desc:0 "While Reichskommissariat Moskowien isn't a specialist colony with specific resources to serve Germany, Moskowien functions as the Eastern European Factory of the Reich, having hundreds of slave workshops operating around the clock throughout the region. These workshops are often producing different types of products under Nazi conglomerates and certain state apparatus, such as the Schutzstaffel."
 TMS_Torch_of_Hope:0 "Beacon of Hope"
 TMS_Torch_of_Hope_desc:0 "With a more attractive slogan and beliefs, the people under the Soviet Democrats found themselves living in a more fair, and refined system than other factions. While certain rights are still limited, citizens of the Soviet Democrats enjoy greater rights and have more power on minor state affairs."

 ANTI_GERMAN_FRONT:0 "Anti-German Coalition"

#LEADER DESC
Paustovsky_DESC:0 "Served as a war correspondent on the Southern Front, Paustovsky was captured by the Wehrmacht when he was attempting to cross the Volga. Paustovsky was sent to a labour camp in Poland, later being relocated to work as a slave labour in Moskowien. Paustovsky was assigned to metalworking factory located in Tver, where he developed anarchist beliefs. He viewed the Soviet's collapse as the failure of the Statist Soviets, where millions of citizens were abandoned by the statists. He also treated the Germans' brutality as the fault of the concept of 'nation', seeing both the Soviets and Nazis as the cause of suppression in Russia.\n\nRadicalized and educated, Paustovsky used his knowledge to convert fellow labourers to the anarchist ideal. With the Death of Hitler, his status in the now crypto-anarchist stronghold was elevated, which he used to launch a righteous revolution in order to pave a new way for the anarchist utopia."
Korzh_DESC:0 "Commander of the Soviet Partisans in Moscow, Korzh has managed to evade numerous attempts on his life done by the Sturmabteilung. His zone of operation remained in the area of Northern Moskowien, where he managed to gain a large amount of followers and equipment with the help of the Soviet Union. Korzh's hit-and-run tactics were proven to be hugely effective, managing to raise an underground army of liberated slave labourers.\n\nKorzh's only aim is to reunify Moscow with the Soviets, no matter the cost of human lives and resources."
POLITICS_SIEGFRIED_KASCHE_DESC:0 "A General Officer of the Sturmabteilung, Siegfried Kasche avoided most SA Officers' fate, barely dodging death by pleaing to Hermann Göring. Later on, Kasche secured the position of Moskowien Reichskommissar with his pandering and politicking towards the German High Command.\n\nKasche has been using the Sturmabteilung as his means of oppression within Moskowien, favouring them over the typical security departments.\n\nKasche is ruthless in reaching production quotas, having zero sympathy towards any non-German living in his 'fiefdom' known as Reichskommissariat Moskowien."
Skorodumov_DESC:0 "Mikhail Skorodumov, a former member of the White Movement during the Russian Civil War, after the defeat of the Soviet Union he became one of the top ranking Nazi collaborator. After the relationship soured between the collaborators and the Reichskommissariat Government, Skorodumov established a hidden circle of resistance, and remained in contact with the Russian Republic in the East. Skorodumov managed to form a government after the slave rebllion sparked in Moskowien, with the goal of reuniting Moscow with the Republic."
Grigorenko_DESC:0 "Petro Grigorenko stayed within the Moskowien Region after the Soviet retreat. In the first years of his resistance career, he and his group of partisans fought under the NKVD's command. However, after the rumours of gross misconducts performed by Lavrentiy Beria surfaced, Grigorenko's group of partisans silently renounced their ties and defied NKVD orders. Grigorenko converted to an ideology of Soviet Democracy, and actively denounced the dictatorial Soviet Union."
Diky_DESC:0 "Andrey Dikiy emigrated to Yugoslavia after the Russian Civil War. Dikiy joined the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, which he became a leading figure within the organisation. After the rule of Nazi Europe consolidated, Dikiy cooperated and praised the Nazis administration. However, the incompetence of Reichskommissariat Moskowien drove his organisation into a more nationalistic stance. While Dikiy retained most of his national socialistic views, his attitude on the Germans changed from cooperation to Russian Nationalism."

 ###########MOSKOWIEN##############
 twrmoskowien.0.t:0 "What Is Going On Over There?"
 twrmoskowien.0.d:0 "News is just coming in - The Fatherlands is in chaos!  There are battles being fought all across the Reich, as various factions and leaders attempt to gain the upper hand.  We must immediately decide how we are going to handle this situation.  The administration must decide who, if anyone they are going to support."
 twrmoskowien.0.a:0 "Dear God, We May Be Doomed..."
 twrmoskowien.1.t:0 "The Advent Of National Bolshevism"
 twrmoskowien.1.d:0 "Moskowien is a Slavic state.  And we are pure Germans.  To avoid en masse revolts and the regime being toppled, things must change.  After several meetings, with communist partisans, and underground slave unions, a compromise has been reached.  We will completely restructure our state, and it's governing ideology.  No more shall slavs be slaves, they shall be workers, with basic socialist rights.  No longer shall the military control all walks of life, the proletarian Germans and Slavs shall form a civilian branch of government.  No longer shall German corporations exploit our resources without paying, we shall institute common land reform.  A new day is rising, and with it, the bright light of National Bolshevism.  The Kommissariat has ended.  The Union Of National Bolshevik Republics has risen.  Long live the UNBR!"
 twrmoskowien.1.a:0 "A New Day for Rossiya has dawned."
 twrmoskowien.2.t:0 "An Error In Implementation"
 twrmoskowien.2.d:0 "We may have let our forces be a bit.....over zealous in their attempts to take out local communications.  Their doing so alerted the locals that something massively wrong must be happening.  It wasnt long before a german officer was kidnapped and revealed what was happening in the Reich.  It would be a grave understatement to say the slavs are now less encouraged to obey our government."
 twrmoskowien.2.a:0 "Um.....Oh god, something drastic must be done....."
 twrmoskowien.3.t:0 "Remember the Kommissariat!"
 twrmoskowien.3.d:0 "Heart-wrenching news is coming out of Moskow.  The city has fallen to the rebellious slavs and their \"Blue Army\".  After months of fighting that made the battles for the Reich look like a tea-party, the last bastion of our troops has fallen.  They held out in the Kommissariat building for over a week after the rest of the city has fallen.  Only four men have returned, using a helicopter to escape, after collecting as many identification tags as they could from the soldiers who stayed behind.  They tell us a truly Hallowed tale.  On the evening the battles was to be fought, the blue army proceeded to blast the old Soviet anthem throughout city speakers, in an attempt to demoralize our forces before attacking.  This did not have the response they desired.  Our troops, lead by their commanding officer began to sing Deutschland Über Alles at the top of their lungs, and played it in their one remaining speaker.  Four almost an hour these men kept singing, while inflicting astronomical casualties on the Blues.  The survivors claim to have heard it literally until the last sound of gunshots, as they flew away.  Even now, many of us can almost hear their voices from the next world, as if their Spirit guides us onward.  All of these men were perhaps the greatest men to ever live and die for the Reich.  We have no current honor fitting for this occasion.  Thus we shall create a new one.  The Order of Eternal Unwavering Loyalty, which shall never again be awarded.  All the men present shall receive this, the Iron Cross First and Second Class, and posthumous promotions to the rank of Colonel, or Field Marshall for their commanding officer."
 twrmoskowien.3.a:0 "Deutschland, Deutschland Über Alles!  Über Alles In Der Welt!"
 twrmoskowien.4.t:0 "Who Shall We Follow?"
 twrmoskowien.4.d:0 "The Reich is in a civil war of unprecedented proportions.  This is only exacerbated by the fact that there are many factions fighting, not just two.  However Only two of them have any semblance of legitimacy in our eyes.  Manstein and the Heer Junta, and Himmler and the SS.  We must decide who to support."
 twrmoskowien.4.a:0 "Manstein is the only sane choice!"
 twrmoskowien.4.b:0 "Himmler is the only righteous option!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.1.t:0 "Slave Defiance"
 twrmoscowuprisings.1.d:0 "The enslaved workers in Moskau caught wind of Hitler's death. Rumours spreaded across the slave communities, some say Hitler was killed by an American spy, when some even claimed that Germany has fallen into chaos,. These rumours sparked a sense of hope amongst the slaves, reports are flooding into our headquarters regarding slaves defying German owners.\n\nThe local SA Branch has decided to take matters into their own hands, refusing to contact Germany for aid while sending their own regiments of paramilitary cells to handle the rowdy slaves."
 twrmoscowuprisings.1.a:0 "How dare are they!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.t:0 "Slave Rebellions"
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.d:0 "Reports of slaves defying their masters turned into reports about Slaves overthrowing their masters and the securities. Small slave rebellions are appearing all over our lands, these slaves are often armed with nothing but simple tools, which make these rebellions no match against the Security Forces. However, the latest small scale slave revolts seem to be armed with old, but capable Soviet arms.\n\nMoscow is occasionally losing contact with her surrounding camps that are dotted around the Reichskommissariat. However, this is declared to be unrelated."
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.a:0 "Quick! I want to know who's supporting these!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.3.t:0 "The Resistance Plot Discovered!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.3.d:0 "The RSHA's swift investigation lasted hours, and we were able to expose two major organisations that are behind the rebellions and acts of defiance. The Security Forces are alerted and are rushing to arrest the leaderships as soon as possible."
 twrmoscowuprisings.3.a:0 "Arrest these degenerates!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.t:0 "The Slavic Revolt"
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.d:0 "Alarmed by our attempts to arrest the rebellious leaderships. The rebel organisations, the Pro-Soviet "Moscow Red Army" and the Pro-Republicans "Provisional Junta" have declared their rebellions against the Reichskommissariat Government.\n\nOther than these two of groups of rebels, more problematic factions appeared, revealing themselves and challenging the Reichskommissariat Government for ultimate control over the former Moscow Oblast.\n\nIn the case of Tver, prisoners from a slavic labour camp have managed to secure control over a considerable size of land, proclaiming an 'Anarchist Stronghold' within the small pocket."
