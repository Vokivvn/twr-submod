#Focus
NOV_prepare_krasnoyarsk:0 "Before I Die..."
NOV_prepare_krasnoyarsk_desc:0 "It's clear the leadership of Drozdov is coming to a end, his mental state is becoming worsened by the pressures of politics and his older age. In order to promote stability within the Nation we must need to unite the people against a common enemy. This will distract the people from their senile leader and let the Generals take the reigns of the country while the nation is at war."
NOV_invade_krasnoyarsk:0 "...I'm Taking The GULAGs Down with Me!"
NOV_invade_krasnoyarsk_desc:0 "Fortunately for us, there is an isolated enemy to our East that poses an ideological conflict with our people, Krasnoyarsk. The Communist state maintains a large group of Gulags from the Purge Era that will make for an easy justification of war. Whoever gets elected after Drozdov will inherit a much larger country and be able to shape a larger people into their image."
NOV_krushchev_wins:0 "Khrushchev's New Democracy"
NOV_krushchev_wins_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the scattering of the Politicians of the Union, Bureaucrats, Generals, Admirals, and even members of the Politburo have fled to our nation. None of them have been as significant as Kruschev, a politician of great importance in our nation, he has led the progressive wing of the nation. Now that Drozdov has left office he found himself voted in by the people and has assembled a cabinet of like minded progressives and socialists. Now his agenda of liberation of the poor, and furthering business restrictions are free to begin becoming legislation."
NOV_krushchev_agrarian_democracy:0 "Social Agrarianism"
NOV_krushchev_agrarian_democracy_desc:0 "If there is anything our nation has a lot of, its open space, our nation possesses great swathes of open land, that is farmable with enough effort, if we intend to expand our economy and trade power, we must utilize the land. We can begin funding for families to move out of the cities and villages and turn open spaces into large farms that produce food for consumption and trading which will turn a profit soon."
NOV_krushchev_reopen_kolkhoz:0 "Recreate The Kolkhozes"
NOV_krushchev_reopen_kolkhoz_desc:0 "The Kolkhoz carry a great legacy within the former Soviet Union, they were a shining example of what Rural Socialism could be in practice, that was until they became a form of rural slavery for those disloyal to the Party agenda. We can copy the early example of Kolkhozes and begin assisting collectivized farms and encourage further migration to them. Collectivized Farms come with the benefit of increased efficiency as more workers live in a single area and produce more than a family farm would."
NOV_krushchev_rural_voting:0 "Rural Voting Census"
NOV_krushchev_rural_voting_desc: "As of the Status Quo, Urban Voting Districts control most of the electoral power and the zones don't account for the increased rural population and drastic decrease in urban population. Funding a census will allow us to rearrange zones and give more electoral power to the communities we helped create and secure our next election through democratic means."
NOV_krushchev_novosibirsk_union:0 "The Novosibirsk Agricultural Union"
NOV_krushchev_novosibirsk_union_desc:0 "Now that we have created a large rural population of middle-class farmers, it's inevitable that capitalists and investors will seek to establish franchises and chains of Farms to line their pockets, to prevent this we must create a national union that will protect the common farmer. Entrance to the union must be accessible and cheap to prevent exploitation as much as possible."
NOV_preparing_for_soviets:0 "Readying Ourselves For The Bear"
NOV_preparing_for_soviets_desc:0 "If we intend to honor the legacy of Russia, we must be able to defend yourself from outside threats, most notably of the Russian States, the Soviets, who inhabit a husk of their former self. If we want to be able to survive a war with them, we must be preparing now, with defensive preparations, and better training for our soldiers."
NOV_norilsk_weapons:0 "The Norilskian Weapons Market"
NOV_norilsk_weapons_desc:0 "Unfortunately for us, our industrial capability isn't great at the moment and we possess a small armaments industry that only makes the bare essentials for our growing military. Fortunately, to our North is Norilsk who have stayed neutral in the seemingly upcoming conflict. Through our border we can begin to ship weapons in for a cost and arm our expanding military in defense of the nation."
NOV_intelligence_service:0 "Creating Our Own Intelligence Service"
NOV_intelligence_service_desc:0 "As of now, we maintain a barebones intelligence community that use outdated technology and strategies to counter the Soviet Threat, we must recreate the intelligence services and fund decryption technology so we can stay one step ahead of the Soviets, not only this but we will begin gathering information on our other neighbors and other places we can go on the offensive."
NOV_yefimov_wins:0 "Yefimov's Status Quo"
NOV_yefimov_wins_desc:0 "So far our nation has gotten along so far under the leadership of Drozdov, unfortunately for us, he is no longer eligible for the job, so we must host a successor that won't radically change the nation and cause it to be unsustainable. Fortunately, we have a politician willing to rise up to the task in the impending election. Alexander Yefimov is a relatively young veteran of the Soviet-German war, whose wartime experience will help us fortify the nation for the impending Soviet threat."
NOV_yefimov_army_democracy:0 "A Democratic Army"
NOV_yefimov_army_democracy_desc:0 "If we do not want our morale to break once our soldiers realize how much the Soviet outnumber them, we must begin the process of democratization within the military. We can begin by allowing soldiers to suggest radical ideas to their officers without punishment and encourage more direct communication between servicemen and lower officers. "
NOV_yefimov_complete_conscription:0 "Complete Formal Conscriptions"
NOV_yefimov_complete_conscription_desc:0 "While we have conscription for several years, the process has been informal and been left to inefficient processes led by local authorities. By reforming the process we can make sure to get every service year possible from our citizens and keep the quantity of our military high."
NOV_yefimov_elected_generals:0 "Elected Generals And Commissars"
NOV_yefimov_elected_generals_desc:0 "If we want to maintain high combat readiness, we need to make the military truely of the people, elected Generals will always represent the soldiers' needs and give them a constant view into the needs of their men. Meanwhile, elected Commissars can justify their actions by Democracy and effectively meet the wants of the men that elect them. Unfortunately, the masses are influenceable and we won't always get the most capable leaders."
NOV_yefimov_armed_democracy:0 "Arm All Eligible Citizens"
NOV_yefimov_armed_democracy_desc:0 "If we want to last long against the Soviets, we must make sure we have a large pool of civilians ready to fight for the country, and if the Soviets win, continue the legacy of Novosibirsk through violent resistance. We must be careful to set requirements for arms distribution, otherwise, those who want to forcefully oppose our nation will have the means to do so."
NOV_transiberian_railroad:0 "Renovating The Transiberian Railroad"
NOV_transiberian_railroad_desc:0 "Ever since Russia has devolved into a state of chaos, the Transiberian Railroad has played an ever more important role in the economy and politics of the area. Unfortunately for us, the railroad hasn't been expanded since 1916 and some sections still use technology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its disappointing to know our infrastructure was built when Russia still had a Czar. By renovating the Railways we can make the internal transportation of resources and products more efficient and allow businesses to begin further away from the financial centers."
NOV_buryatian_offer:0 "Offer to Maintain Buryatia's Segment"
NOV_buryatian_offer_desc:0 "Near Baikal, is the Buryatia region, which poses a strategic ally as its far enough to avoid conflict, and close enough to act as an ally."
NOV_republican_offer:0 "Overtures To Republican Rail Interests"
NOV_republican_offer_desc:0 "If we want to increase trade beyond our country, we must begin talks with the republic of Russia. By cooperating with them to develop our railroad infrastructure we can begin shipping products and resources across the border. Not only will this increase trade but help improve relations with our republican neighbors."
NOV_ligachev_wins:0 "Ligachev's Landing Strip"
NOV_ligachev_wins_desc:0 "One of the likeliest leaders of our nation is the native born, reformer and ambitious liberal, Yegor Ligachev. His agenda consists of reconnecting ourselves with the outside world by habitating air travel and diplomatically and economically cooperating with the outside world. Out of all three mainstream candidates, he is the most plausible, with support from the left and right as he strays away from the status quo, without causing radical change."
NOV_ligachev_connect_to_world:0 "Re-Connect To The World Market"
NOV_ligachev_connect_to_world_desc:0 "One of the most important changes we can enact is reopening to the world market, both Germany and American Spheres of influence pose good economic allies and their resources can facilitate greater industry. Not only that, but we will show to the world that we are like every other nation and are no longer just a small country in Southern Siberia."
NOV_ligachev_novo_air:0 "Novosibirsk Airlines"
NOV_ligachev_novo_air_desc:0 "If we want to establish a happy populace, we must facilitate regular travel between Novosibirsk and the outside world. We can encourage the tourism industry internally and externally and make Novosibirisk a place to go in the summer to avoid the heat. The Airlines start up will begin racking up money overtime and we will begin reaping the rewards of the business start up."
NOV_ligachev_novosibirsk_airport:0 "The New Novosibirsk Airport"
NOV_ligachev_novosibirsk_airport_desc:0 "If we want to encourage further tourism within our country, we need to start anew and make an entirely new airport, rather than forcing tourists to use the old, dirt, landing strips made for business use. Soon, thousands of German and Americans will flood into the country to experience the democratic stronghold within the Russian States."
NOV_ligachev_siberian_miracle:0 "The Siberian Miracle"
NOV_ligachev_siberian_miracle_desc:0 "It took a lot of effort, and reforms were necessary, but a little nation in Siberia called Novosibirsk has become economically stable recently, a solid piece of evidence that stability and reform can be accomplished within the Russian States. Many other Russian states will suffer, meanwhile, our people live with high wages, comfortable housing, and developing industry."
NOV_drop_of_calm:0 "A Drop Of Calm In A Chaotic Sea"
NOV_drop_of_calm_desc:0 "No matter who became the next leader of Novosibirsk, the country has received reform, and almost like the nation was blessed by the god, managed to practically implement that reform. The people are happy and celebrations are regular occurrences, whether spontaneous or government backed. The opposition remains calm, and makes coalitions rather than enemies, and protests are listened to, rather than beaten up. It's fair to say the Russian people have lived on and found a place to make a home, in the chaotic world of Russian politics."
NOV_man_with_a_mission:0 "A Man With A Mission....."
NOV_man_with_a_mission_desc:0 "Khrushchev is an ambitious leader, and his ambitions extend far beyond the regions that the army of Novosibirsk currently controls, and even beyond Siberia. Now that he has secured his power over the Novosibirsk government itself, he can begin planning and preparations for his broader mission..."
NOV_and_an_insane_idea:0 ".....And A Risky Plan"
NOV_and_an_insane_idea_desc:0 "Everyone knows that Russia must be reunified to face the Nazis and rebuild itself, but Khrushchev understands that neither the Perm government, corrupted by years of Beria's rule, nor the Russian puppets in Vladivostok, are worthy leaders. If Russia is to be reunified, it must be done under Khrushchev himself."
NOV_madmans_troika:0 "Forming The Madman's Troika"
NOV_madmans_troika_desc:0 "Alone, Novosibirsk certainly does not have the power to attack the Soviet rump state and march on Perm. However, far west, there are states that oppose the Perm government too, like Idel Ural and Transvolga. If they can be brought into alliance with us, the Soviet rump could be attacked on both sides and perhaps defeated."
NOV_ending_a_sad_story:0 "Ending The Union's Sad Story"
NOV_ending_a_sad_story_desc:0 "We have done our best at building a coalition, and now the time has come. The corrupted remains of what used to be a great Soviet Union shall be destroyed, and our armies, and those of our allies, will march on Perm and seize the mantle of leadership of all Russia."
NOV_siberian_unification_campaign:0 "Moving Into The Siberian Warlords"
NOV_siberian_unification_campaign_desc:0 "Now that we have seized the mantle of the legitimate Russian government and formed the Russian People's Republic, the remaining Siberian warlords are but traitorous rebel states to be crushed and absorbed into the new Russia. Onwards, east!"
NOV_far_east:0 "Reclaiming The Far East"
NOV_far_east_desc:0 "It was the Americans who cynically invaded Russia's Far Eastern territories at our moment of greatest weakness at the hands of the Nazis, and now still their puppets remain, enforcing a corrupt rule from Vladivostok. These traitors must be destroyed, we will march all the way to the Pacific and retake the lands that are ours!"
NOV_western_unification_campaign:0 "Uniting Western Russia"
NOV_western_unification_campaign_desc:0 "Now that we have seized the mantle of the legitimate Russian government and formed the Russian People's Republic, Western Russia, seized and subjugated by the Nazis in the most terrible war in memory, must be liberated. The great cities of Moscow and Petrograd must be retaken! Onwards, west!"
NOV_into_ukraine:0 "Reclaiming Ukraine"
NOV_into_ukraine_desc:0 "Being from the Russia-Ukraine border, Khrushchev is acutely aware of the connected destinies of these two countries. The Germans seized and enslaved Ukraine to provide food for their evil empire, now it must be liberated and brought back into union with all the Russias."
NOV_central_asia:0 "Uniting Central Asia"
NOV_central_asia_desc:0 "The regions of southern Central Asia, of Turkestan, were lost as the old Soviet Union collapsed. These territories, though inhabited by people with different languages, cultures and religion, are core lands of the Russian state. They must be reintegrated into the new Russian People's Republic."
NOV_condemn_marxism:0 "Condemning Marxist Economics"
NOV_condemn_marxism_desc:0 "While the Soviet Union had some success, we must recognise that ultimately, the Marxist experiment was a failure. We must salvage what parts of it benefited us and the Russian state, and abandon those parts that led to these decades of catastrophe that we found ourselves in."
NOV_rebuilding_russia:0 "Rebuilding The Nation's Economy"
NOV_rebuilding_russia_desc:0 "Years of Nazi occupation and destruction, and then civil war, has left our nation in utter and total destruction. In terms of the economy, there is little to speak of as all infrastructure and industry is totally destroyed. The road towards reconstruction will be long, but we must make a start."
NOV_integrating_nazi_infrastructure:0 "Integrating Former Nazi Infrastructure"
NOV_integrating_nazi_infrastructure_desc:0 "One area of infrastructure that does remain is that build by the Nazi occupiers in the west of the country. Mines, railway lines and transport links maintained and expanded to extract resources back to Germany with Russian labour. Now that we have seized these for ourselves, it only makes sense to repurpose what remains to the benefit of the Russian people, rather than the Germans."
NOV_german_deportations:0 "Deport Remaining German Settlers"
NOV_german_deportations_desc:0 "In the last war, the Germans tried to annihilate us and drive the survivors from our lands, and settlers came to take the land we lived on. Now that these territories have been liberated, those German settlers that were unfortunate enough not to escape have become prisoners of ours. It is obvious that these invaders cannot be allowed to stay - they will be deported back to Germany from where they came."
NOV_refugee_resettlement:0 "Refugee Resettlement Programs"
NOV_refugee_resettlement_desc:0 "As the Nazi invaders tore through the Soviet Union, millions fled ahead of them, scrambling to get over the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line and into Central Asia and the Ural region. Now that we have liberated the west, an area now heavily depopulated by the brutal occupation, war and refugee movements, these refugees can return home and be resettled in the liberated territories as we rebuild."
NOV_russia_focused_programs:0 "Russian Oriented Development Plan"
NOV_russia_focused_programs_desc:0 "Within our new nation, core Russia is the most important area. Past experience has shown us how vulnerable peripheral regions can be to foreign invasion. As a result, development must be concentrated primarily deep inside our vast territory, within the core of Russia."
NOV_fairly_focused_programs:0 "Equally Distributed Development Plan"
NOV_fairly_focused_programs_desc:0 "If we are to build a fair and stable nation, all parts of it must be equally prioritised in redevelopment. Focusing only on the core will leave the periphery weak and resentful, and would only threaten the stability of the union as a whole."
NOV_subsidizing_russian_industry:0 "Subsidizing Intact Russian Industry"
NOV_subsidizing_russian_industry_desc:0 "What little pre-war Russian industry remains intact and salvageable must be kickstarted and up and running as quickly as possible. The government should subsidize any initial investments needed to restart our old industry."
NOV_subsidizing_russian_agriculture:0 "Subsidizing Former Soviet Farms"
NOV_subsidizing_russian_agriculture_desc:0 "As our people struggle from a lack of food, the farms that were seized and destroyed by the Germans must be rebuilt. We must aid in the redistribution of this land and for farming to begin again so that food can be provided for our suffering people."
NOV_siberian_resource_ventures:0 "Subsidizing Siberian Resource Ventures"
NOV_siberian_resource_ventures_desc:0 "Siberia, though a desolate and remote area, is nonetheless a vast region of untapped potential. Huge amounts of resources like oil, gas and metals lie under many of its untouched areas. As we move towards an economic recovery, we must make sure to explore Siberia and begin to utilise the potential of this resource-rich region."
NOV_creating_state_railways:0 "Creating A State Railway Corporation"
NOV_creating_state_railways_desc:0 "Railways are the greatest method of mass overland transportation and are the sign of a true industrialised nation and economy. Unfortunately, turmoil has led to the destruction of many of Russia's railways. To oversee reconstruction across the nation, we should create a national railway company with the job of doing just that."
NOV_ukrainian_agriculture:0 "Rebuilding Lost Ukrainian Agriculture"
NOV_ukrainian_agriculture_desc:0 "Ukraine used to be the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, before it was seized by the Nazis and turned into the unwilling breadbasket of the German Reich. Now that we have retaken the territories of Ukraine, we must rebuild and reinvigorate the old agricultural industries of the region to help feed our nation."
NOV_central_asian_infrastructure:0 "Rebuilding Central Asian Infrastructure"
NOV_central_asian_infrastructure_desc:0 "Civil war has torn apart the old Soviet-era infrastructure in Central Asia. Now that we have secured the region for ourselves, we should set about rebuilding old roads, rail and industries that have since fallen into disrepair, to ingrate the region into the new Russian nation."
NOV_rostov_conference:0 "The Rostov Conference"
NOV_rostov_conference_desc:0 "In a world where all of the world's countries are looking towards Washington and Berlin for sources of political alignment, there isn't much space left for those who do not wish to take a side in the cold war. We will provide that space for neutrality in the city of Rostov, and we will invite all of the powers which have not yet aligned themselves towards either Germany or America."
NOV_sweden_diplomacy:0 "Overtures To Sweden"
NOV_sweden_diplomacy_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few powers left in Europe which does not have any firm allegiance to Germany or the United States. If we are to build a truly comprehensive non-aligned movement, we must ensure that we have their attention in Rostov."
NOV_turkey_diplomacy:0 "Overtures To Turkey"
NOV_turkey_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Turkish nation stands at the crossroads between the realms of Europe and Asia. Their membership in the German or American spheres of influences would greatly bolster their standings in the cold war, but Turkey has not chosen a side as of now. We should encourage them to remain that way, for they hold a great piece of geographical leverage."
NOV_china_diplomacy:0 "Overtures to the Kuomtang"
NOV_china_diplomacy_desc:0 "China is the largest country in the world with no explicit political affiliation in the cold war. Although they were allied with the western powers in the war against the Japanese empire, they have not made any further commitments to the Toronto Accord. It is in the interests of all non-aligned countries to have China on our side."
NOV_india_diplomacy:0 "Overtures To The Republic Of India"
NOV_india_diplomacy_desc:0 "India stands second to China as the largest non-aligned power on earth. We should bring their representatives to Rostov, should we have the strongest organization we could possibly have."
NOV_non_aligned_movement:0 "Founding Of The Non-Aligned Movement"
NOV_non_aligned_movement_desc:0 "The Rostov conference was a success! All of the relevant countries agreed with our ideas on our nation standings relative to those of Germany and America, and we can now go ahead with officially declare the Non-Aligned Movement. Huzzah!"


#Events
twrNovosibirsk.1.t:0 "The Rostov Conference"
twrNovosibirsk.1.d:0 "In the newly liberated city of Rostov, Khrushchev, leader of the Russian People's Republic, plays hosts to his guests - representatives of many neutral and non-aligned nations around the world.\n\nIt is an overall jovial affair, with national leaders taking time to enjoy the occasion. However, most importantly, plans are discussed, plans of turning the idea of the non-aligned movement into a true international organisation. It will take much more negotiation to turn these plans into a reality, but the groundworks have been laid."
twrNovosibirsk.1.a:0 "To a brighter future!"
twrNovosibirsk.2.t:0 "The Non-Aligned Movement"
twrNovosibirsk.2.d:0 "With preparations complete, we can officially launch the non-aligned movement.\n\n(Any countries that agreed will become members)"
twrNovosibirsk.2.a:0 "Forwards Together!"
twrNovosibirsk.3.t:0 "The Death of Drozdov"
twrNovosibirsk.3.d:0 "In an event that many had foreseen for years, General and military scientist Nikolai Fedorovich Drozdov, commander of the Novosibirsk army, has died. Preparing for this day, much of his power had already been passed on to his subordinates, who must now decide between them who will lead the army into the future.\n\nPerhaps the favourite choice is Nikita Khrushchev, formerly a high-up communist official who became very disillusioned with the Communist Party as Beria seized power and the Soviet Union collapsed.\n\nThen, there is Alexander Yefimov, a distinguished pilot and flight commander from the war against the Nazis, who was Drozdov's personal favourite to be successor and carry on his legacy, but is very young and does not have the same backing from other figures.\n\nFinally, there is Ligachev, another former Communist and rival to Khrushchev, who emphasises the need to rebuild the territory currently under our control instead of opening new campaigns.\n\nWho will lead us forward?"
twrNovosibirsk.3.a:0 "Khruschev will lead us!"
twrNovosibirsk.3.b:0 "Yefimov will lead us!"
twrNovosibirsk.3.c:0 "Ligachev will lead us!"
twrNovosibirsk.4.t:0 "The Coming Battle"
twrNovosibirsk.4.d:0 "General Drozdov, now almost 90, is incredibly old, and it is clear to all that his end is fast approaching. With a body that's failing but a mind that still has strength, though, Drozdov has drawn up plans for a final battle on the road to Russian reunification - an attack against the warlord state of Krasnoyarsk and its GULAGs.\n\nIt is doubtful whether Drozdov himself will even live to see the beginning of this campaign, let alone those that may or may not come after it, but whoever comes after him, he hopes, will carry the torch forward."
twrNovosibirsk.4.a:0 "One final mission from the old general"
twrNovosibirsk.5.t:0 "Khrushchev's Mission"
twrNovosibirsk.5.d:0 "In many ways, Khrushchev's vision far exceeds that of the late Drozdov, or of any of his rivals. The man has set his sights on nothing less than the reunification of all Russia and the liberation of the western territories. Now that he has secured power as commander of the Novosibirsk army, he is determined to turn this vision into a reality."
twrNovosibirsk.5.a:0 "The campaign begins"
twrNovosibirsk.6.t:0 "Looking Forwards"
twrNovosibirsk.6.d:0 "Of course, Khrushchev recognises that the greatest obstacle to his plan, apart from the Nazis, is the rump Soviet government that remains in Perm. Corrupted by Beria and his dark forces, what was left of the Soviet Union had long gained the disdain of a disillusioned Khrushchev. If Russia is to be reunified by a forward-looking, capable government, the last remnant of the worst of the old Soviet government had to be destroyed.\n\nTo that end, however, the armies of Novosibirsk are probably not enough on their own to defeat the remains of the Soviet army that answer to Perm. To that end, we should look around the Soviet Union for allies to form our coalition, such as to Transvolga and Idel Ural, so that we can strike at the Perm government as one!"
twrNovosibirsk.6.a:0 "Towards reunification!"
twrNovosibirsk.7.t:0 "Alliance with Novosibirsk"
twrNovosibirsk.7.d:0 "Word comes from Novosibirks, and its new leader Khrushchev, that plans are in place for a coalition with which to defeat the rump Soviet government in Perm. In the message, Novosibirsk is asking for us to join their Russian Liberation Front and soon attack the Soviet remnant. Should we accept?"
twrNovosibirsk.7.a:0 "Join forces with them"
twrNovosibirsk.7.b:0 "We shouldn't involve ourselves"
twrNovosibirsk.8.t:0 "Alliance with Novosibirsk"
twrNovosibirsk.8.d:0 "Word comes from Novosibirks, and its new leader Khrushchev, that plans are in place for a coalition with which to defeat the rump Soviet government in Perm. In the message, Novosibirsk is asking for us to join their Russian Liberation Front and soon attack the Soviet remnant. Should we accept?"
twrNovosibirsk.8.a:0 "Join forces with them"
twrNovosibirsk.8.b:0 "We shouldn't involve ourselves"
twrNovosibirsk.9.t:0 "Transvolga Accepts"
twrNovosibirsk.9.d:0 "The Transvolga army has accepted our alliance and joined our faction"
twrNovosibirsk.9.a:0 "Excellent"
twrNovosibirsk.10.t:0 "Transvolga Refuses"
twrNovosibirsk.10.d:0 "The Transvolga army has unfortunately refused our alliance and has not joined our faction"
twrNovosibirsk.10.a:0 "Unfortunate"
twrNovosibirsk.11.t:0 "Idel Ural Accepts"
twrNovosibirsk.11.d:0 "Idel Ural has accepted our alliance and joined our faction"
twrNovosibirsk.11.a:0 "Excellent"
twrNovosibirsk.12.t:0 "Idel Ural Refuses"
twrNovosibirsk.12.d:0 "Idel Ural has unfortunately refused our alliance and has not joined our faction"
twrNovosibirsk.12.a:0 "Unfortunate"
twrNovosibirsk.13.t:0 "Take the Mantle"
twrNovosibirsk.13.d:0 "With the Soviet rump state beaten and taken by us and our allies, we find ourselves as the predominant Russian power. No longer are we a mere warlord state, now we are the holders claims over all of Russia. We will become the Russian People's Republic, and our new mission is reunification of the whole nation!"
twrNovosibirsk.13.a:0 "Forward!"
twrNovosibirsk.14.t:0 "Non-Aligned Movement"
twrNovosibirsk.14.d:0 "Following a conference in Rostov, the Russian Republic is eager to set up its Non-aligned Movement organisation, a project to bring together countries that are not aligned officially towards a global power bloc. We have been invited to take part. Shall we accept?\n\n(The non-aligned movement is not a faction, but will result in gaining a national idea when the movement is officially founded)"
twrNovosibirsk.14.a:0 "Of course!"
twrNovosibirsk.14.b:0 "It is not to our advantage"
twrNovosibirsk.15.t:0 "Sweden Accepts"
twrNovosibirsk.15.d:0 "Sweden has accepted our invitation to the future non-aligned movement organisation"
