#Focus
NRI_questionable_food:0 "By God...This Food Has Man!"
NRI_questionable_food_desc:0 "Our situation over our food supplies has hit rock bottom! Our people have now resorted to eating their fellow men, women and children in order to survive!"
NRI_stop_it:0 "This Will End Immediately!"
NRI_stop_it_desc:0 "Cannibalism is an atrocity against all that is holy and human! We must end this practice and try to find some way to feed our people!"
NRI_let_it_happen:0 "Let It Happen..."
NRI_let_it_happen_desc:0 "Maybe it's for the best that we turn a blind eye to the issue of cannibalism at the current time. We don't really have any other way to feed the people so for now, lets just allow them to continue while we address the issue of our food supplies."
NRI_raiding_parties:0 "Raid The Neighbors For Food"
NRI_raiding_parties_desc:0 "Our lands are barren and hunting animals is a hard and rare occurrence. We must feed ourselves and our people and our neighbouring nations have more food than they can use. We will send our military to raid the nearby cities and towns of our neighbours for food."
NRI_oil_for_food:0 "Trade Oil For Food"
NRI_oil_for_food_desc:0 "Our land may be barren but the soil below it is rich with black gold. We should extract it and trade it with our neighbours in exchange for food. Its not much use to us anyway as of current."
NRI_farms:0 "Construct Limited Greenhouse Farms"
NRI_farms_desc:0 "We must be able to provide at least a small part of our dietary needs. The harsh Siberian environment may not allow for anything to grow but if we make greenhouses, we will be able to control the climate for our crops to grow."
NRI_glaciaculture:0 "Glaciaculture Fisheries"
NRI_glaciaculture_desc:0 "Under the thick ice of Siberia, tons of fish wait for us to fish them and feed ourselves with them. We must try to expand our operations in Glaciaculture to make it a feasible and steady source of food."
NRI_reprocessing_plants:0 "Reprocessing Plants"
NRI_reprocessing_plants_desc:0 "We can't ignore the problem of cannibalism but we can try in some way to make it safer and maybe even profitable for us. By establishing processing plants, we will make use of the human body...to its fullest extent."
NRI_demand_quality:0 "Demand Animal Instead Of Human Meat"
NRI_demand_quality_desc:0 "We can't keep eating each other! We must become human again! We must have cow, pig and chicken in our plate instead of our fellow man!"
NRI_threaten_exposure:0 "Threaten To Reveal This!"
NRI_threaten_exposure_desc:0 "We have been getting letters from individuals saying that they will expose our…industries behind the issue of cannibalism. We must put an official end to cannibalism before we have the people pick up their guns against us."
NRI_expand_glaciaculture:0 "Expand Glaciaculture Industry"
NRI_expand_glaciaculture_desc:0 "Our initial attempt at glaciaculture fisheries has been a success, with our food supply ever-expanding. We must continue investing in it and soon enough we will be able to resolve the problem of cannibalism once and for all."

NRI_lack_of_everything:0 "A Lack Of...Everything"
NRI_lack_of_everything_desc:0 "With our food situation... solved one way or another we know can focus on fixing the elephant in the room. An elephant so large we all didn't even notice it at all. We didn't just lack proper access to food, we lacked a proper political system in the first place. \n\nThe two main contenders currently seem to be...\"Crypto-Syndicalism\" and the economic policies of a certain Alisa Rosenbaum."

NRI_crypto_syndicalism:0 "Crypto-Syndicalism Doctrine"
NRI_crypto_syndicalism_desc:0 "A refined version of syndicalism, crypto-syndicalism advocates for an even higher form of equality within society: by making even the act of revealing ones identity to the public a choice. No more will have the people fear potential backlash by overzealous comrades for now not ones appearance, gender or even manner of speech shall be a deterrent from participating in society: only ones conviction and words."
NRI_food:0 "Right To Food"
NRI_food_desc:0 "Under the accursed capitalist system, workers are held at gunpoint to whore themselves out in wage slavery under the capitalist pigs, lest they risk homelessness, starvation and death. Unfortunately even some attempts at making away with this enslavement have still used that deterrent to chain the people, like in the Union to the east. \n\nNo more, from thenceforth every one of our citizens shall be entitled to their fixed share no matter what they do and who they are."
NRI_anonymity:0 "Right To Anonymity"
NRI_anonymity_desc:0 "The councils and co-ops whilst freeing the workers from the grip of the capitalist are still of some error: for except the civility of those in the council, there is no way of protecting a comrade who may voice unpopular concerns or opinions from potential backlash. Worse yet unsavory individuals may strongarm and intimidate councils and chain them to their will, the right to anonymity in all forms public shall change that."
NRI_survival:0 "Right To Survival"
NRI_survival_desc:0 "A guaranteed full belly and the absolute freedom to make ones voice heard are not enough to truly create the socialist utopia envisioned so long ago: to truly blossom, the people need to be provided also with the basic utilities of life. Public housing shall be made widely available as well as securing access to public utilities for all."
NRI_bureau_of_coordination:0 "Bureau Of Coordination"
NRI_bureau_of_coordination_desc:0 "After the disaster of our food situation and inability of the ministry of agriculture to explore proper alternatives, the workers controlled Bureau of Coordination shall ensure maximum efficiency in all sectors agriculture and industrial. So that the erratic planning of previous governments may soon be distant memory."
NRI_bureau_of_distribution:0 "Bureau Of Distribution"
NRI_bureau_of_distribution_desc:0 "For our policies of the right to food and survival to work we must make absolutely sure that each and everyone of our citizens receives their rightful share. None shall hoard anymore than their daily allocated ration and any excess production shall be immediately distributed for the good of all."
NRI_collectivize_glaciaculture:0 "Collectivize Glaciaculture"
NRI_collectivize_glaciaculture_desc:0 "Soon after its inception already the largest branch of Norlinsks industry, the Glaciaculture like no other branch has served to truly elevate the livelihood and prosperity of our people. And it shall continue doing so, now controlled not by capitalists who only seek their own profit but by the people toiling the glaciers."
NRI_cyclical_management:0 "Cyclical Public Management"
NRI_cyclical_management_desc:0 "To ensure that no cliques or groups can form that pervert or equalist ideals within one co-op or factory, the management and workers of one workplace shall be cyclically re-shuffled. This also has the further effect of making the workers even more eagerly work on improving their farm or factory as their time in each is rather limited."
NRI_heat_conserving_architecture:0 "Heat Conserving Architecture"
NRI_heat_conserving_architecture_desc:0 "Up here, beyond the arctic circle every chunk of wood, every little candle counts as to ensure the continued ability of us to survive here. A singular power or fuel outage can prove devastating for entire settlements. New insulating measures and architecture that is designed from the ground up to conserve as much energy as possible will hopefully alleviate some of that blight."
NRI_siberian_crypto_collective:0 "The Siberian Crypto-Collective"
NRI_siberian_crypto_collective_desc:0 "Behind forever frozen glaciers and unending snowstorms a tiny lantern is lighted. A beacon of true equality and prosperity for all. Not wrought by the abuses and horrors inflicted by the soviets but truly for and by the workers. A beacon of hope not just for the refugees of the abuses and hardships of the rest of Russia but the entire world. A small light in a world of darkness."

NRI_rand:0 "Randian Economic Policies"
NRI_rand_desc:0 "Collectivism is the tribal premise of primordial savages who, unable to conceive of individual rights, believed that the tribe is a supreme, omnipotent ruler, that it owns the lives of its members and may sacrifice them whenever it pleases. \n\nLife is hard in Siberia and will continue doing so for perhaps forever. Alas what better than a philosophy that complete shuns any form of cooperation and collective in favor of total individualism: unfettered self-interest being the highest good and altruism the lowest evil."
NRI_human_capital:0 "Human Labor Capital"
NRI_human_capital_desc:0 "Slavery, whilst for some reason condemned by most modern governments, has one thing in common with our main export of oil: being immensely profitable. Whilst we don't want slaver gangs running around kidnapping some of our downtrodden citizenry, also most certainly hilarious, we shall legalize the acts of selling oneself into slavery as well as private slaving companies enslaving enemies they catch in raids."
NRI_absolute_privitization:0 "Absolute Privitization Of Life"
NRI_absolute_privitization_desc:0 "A state, even if a statelet such as we are now, is ultimately a tool squash the individual. We shall now formally liberate all of our people by privatizing the entire state apparatus. The military shall be run by companies, roads, schools, utilities, water, air, housing everything shall be in private hand and all for the better for it. Never again shall the brave entrepreneurs of Russia be enslaved by misguided bureaucrats."
NRI_poverty_fault_of_impoverished:0 "Poverty is The Fault Of The Impoverished"
NRI_poverty_fault_of_impoverished_desc:0 "There is no such thing as a free lunch that much is clear to anyone but the most die hard Social Democrat, but think about it, every human life from its conception eats away the resources of the land. Alas is it not their fault that they have nothing to eat if born into poverty? For they consume ample resources since they took their first breath. We really shouldn't pamper them, should we?"
NRI_business_owner_councils:0 "Business Owner Councils"
NRI_business_owner_councils_desc:0 "Whilst at first glance contrary to our goal of squashing collectives, with the Republic and Union slowly making their first moves towards unity again, the freedom and prosperity we have just required could be rather short lived. As such our brave business owners and captains of the industry shall have ample opportunity to plan for and profit off the coming war and future of our now non-statelet."
NRI_legalize_black_market:0 "Deregulate Black Market"
NRI_legalize_black_market_desc:0 "Critics may claim that the black market jeopardizes perfectly fine law abiding companies via price dumping, the truth is there is ultimately no purer entrepreneurial spirit than that of those brave men and women who sneak across the border at night to flood the streets with fresh illicit goods. Those who complain are simply not cut out for the live of a business owner and should consider selling themselves into slavery instead."
NRI_lease_out_military:0 "Lease Out Special Military Units"
NRI_lease_out_military_desc:0 "The other warlords of Russia are for some reason really hellbent on the idea of uniting Russia, and who are we to stop them? For their myriad successful and unsuccessful ventures are immensely profitable for those tinkering their weapons and whilst some may claim that this jeopardizes our defensive capabilities we shall become one of those tinkerers ourselves now."
NRI_glacial_petroleum_endeavors:0 "Glacial Petroleum Extraction Teams"
NRI_glacial_petroleum_endeavors_desc:0 "No, don't worry the usage of the word \"Team\" here only refers to allocated members of a business in the extraction process here. For deep down under the the nigh impenetrable sheets of ice lies the fabled black gold that every state on this world so desperately hungers for. And which we certainly would be huffing right now if we were busy making fat stacks of cash."
NRI_human_life_capital:0 "Human Life Capital"
NRI_human_life_capital_desc:0 "Human labor like anything in the field of economics is ultimately just a number, a factor as to produce a certain product. And if that number is unable to perform properly is it not the best right of the entrepreneur to make it meet production quotas? Anyways labor protection laws are going to be all abolished."
NRI_novorossiya_trade_consortium:0 "Novorossiyan Trade Consortium"
NRI_novorossiya_trade_consortium_desc:0 "Behind forever frozen glaciers and unending snowstorms a golden light shines. One of true freedom and prosperity, unshackled by any state imposing itself on the ingenuity of those who have bled tooth and nail to accumulate their capital."
