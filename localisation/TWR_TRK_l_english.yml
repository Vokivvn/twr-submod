One of the oldest leaders the world has seen, he left his last breath at the age of 95, leaving the people of Turkestan under the rule of his son, Zyiautdin Khan ibn Eshon Babakhan, an incompetent trader. With no intent to rule, he enjoys the lavish lifestyle of being the ruler of a nation while it begins to crumble around him."

  twrtrk.3.t:0 "End of the Civil War"

  twrtrk.4.t:0 "Turkestani Civil War"
  twrtrk.4.d:0 "With the rise of an incompetent ruler, the already unstable nation of Turkestan has found herself collapsing into a brutal civil war. Local nationalists representing the many ethnic groups in the region have armed themselves in an attempt to secure their freedom from the grip of Turkestani Government.\nWhile this war is mainly between the nationalists and the Loyalists, a faction of democrats in the Turkestan government managed to secure enough land to become a comparable faction in the civil war.\n\nPassing the point of no return, these disagreements in Turkestan must be settled by force, and this civil war will only end with the total collapse of Turkestan, or the defeat of nationalists."
  twrtrk.4.a:0 "How chaotic..."
  twrtrk.41.t:0 "Turkestan Dissolved"
  twrtrk.41.d:0 "After a brief experiment of Turkic unity during the Soviet collapse, the state of Turkestan is no more.\n\nWith the last shots fired and the dust settled, former Turkestan has been divided between the local resistance groups, with nations such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan openly calling for closer cooperation with the Soviet Union, some even suggest that these newly created states should join the Soviet Union as a way to rebuilt law and order in the Central Steppe.\n\nRight after a brutal civil conflict, tensions are building once again. Perhaps peace and stability were never meant for this cruel region?"
  twrtrk.41.a:0 "So long, Turkestan."
  twrtrk.42.t:0 "Central Asian People's Republic"
  twrtrk.42.d:0 "While technically not part of the Soviet Union, this newly proclaimed state is heavily influenced and supported by the Soviets. Named the Central Asian People's Republic (CAPR), this republic was declared by a so-called "Central Asian Politburo", with the help of Soviet advisors. This new nation's goal is to unite the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and the Kyrgyz into one socialist republic.\n\nWhile this might appear to be a repeat of the Turkestan experiment, the CAPR has gained a massive advantage by having the Soviet Union as their prime partner. And with a relatively modern army, comparing to the ones in Central Asia, the CAPR can use these resources to unify this region quicker than ever before."
  twrtrk.42.a:0 "Central Asia turns RED!"
  twrtrk.5.t:0 "Membership Offer"
  twrtrk.5.d:0 "Being the former leaders of our land, the Soviet Union has sent us a telegram, congratulating us about the liberation of our homeland. However, this telegram of congratulation came with a message, the Soviet Union's formal invitation to join the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic as a Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nThey promised great autonomy and unchanged leadership for the member republics, alongside the long awaited law and stability into our regions.\n\nShould we join the Union or remain as an independent Republic?"
  twrtrk.5.a:0 "We accept the offer!"
  twrtrk.5.b:0 "I value my freedom above stability..."
  twrtrk.6.t:0 "Fate of Central Asia"
  twrtrk.6.d:0 "With Turkestan out of the picture, a number of Socialist Republics were established in the Turkestani Civil War. This is the golden opportunity for us to restore order within the Central Asian regions, with the Turkmens and Kazakhs expected to be loyal supporters of the Union.\n\nHowever, due to the resources needed for our upcoming reclamation, we have a plan to establish a friendly sister republic in Central Asia, making the task of enforcing control an easier task for the Soviet Union."
  twrtrk.6.a:0 "Central Asia awaits!"
  twrtrk.6.b:0 "Let's leave those plans alone."
  twrtrk.51.t:0 "Central Asian Plan"
  twrtrk.51.d:0 "This morning, a group of Soviet ambassadors handed us a sounding proposal.\n\nThey suggest that, the Soviet Union is optimistic on the prospect of a possible 'Central Asian People's Republic'. It states that, the Soviet Union is willing to send an overwhelming amount of support to us if we seek to unify the recently fractured nations of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. However, the Soviets wish to gain a chunk of the gained territory."
  twrtrk.51.a:0 "For the Central Asian People's Republic!"
  twrtrk.51.b:0 "No thanks."
  twrtrk.52.t:0 "Tajiks Refused"
  twrtrk.52.d:0 "Even with our favourable political deal, the Tajiks have refused, citing stability and recovering as their reasoning behind such an action. Our plans for Central Asia might have to be altered for now."
  twrtrk.52.a:0 "Their loss."
  twrtrk.53.t:0 "Upholding the Deal"
  twrtrk.53.d:0 "With the annexation of Uzbekistan, as the agreement entails, we must hand over Northern Uzbekistan as a gesture of appreciation for the Soviets' support in the unification war."
  twrtrk.53.a:0 "Hand them the land."
  twrtrk.54.t:0 "Central Asian-Soviet Friendship Treaty"
  twrtrk.54.d:0 "With the destruction of Uzbek nationalists, the Central Asian People's Republic has upheld our proposal. They have formally granted Soviet control over Northern Uzbekistan, in exchange for Soviet political support and resources.\n\nThe task of ruling this troubled land should be accomplished through this semi-puppet republic."
  twrtrk.54.a:0 "A Fair Deal Indeed."
  twrtrk.5001.t:0 "Unification of Kazakh SSR"
  twrtrk.5001.d:0 "After years of separation, the divided lands of Kazakhstan has finally been reunited. At long last, Soviet troops marched into former Turkestani Kazakhstan, hailed as liberators by the local Kazakhs, whom have been praying for the return of order in these lawless lands."
  twrtrk.5001.a:0 "Rejoice!"
  twrtrk.5002.t:0 "Formation of Turkmen SSR"
  twrtrk.5002.d:0 "In an election held by the Turkmen Politburo, the people have overwhelming agreed to rejoin the Soviet Union as the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nSince the collapse in the Western Front, our authority has not been able to reach Turkmen soils. But, at long last, Soviet troops are finally liberating the once oppressed Turkmens."
